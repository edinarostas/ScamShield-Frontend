# ScamShield Client
## Overview

ScamShield is an advanced machine learning tool designed for messaging platforms, integrated within a mockup re-commerce storefront. This tool visually demonstrates how it detects potential scam messages, alerting users in real-time to protect them from scams and safeguarding their personal information. Additionally, ScamShield is being developed as an integratable tool, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into existing websites.

## Problem

Messaging platforms, particularly in e-commerce settings, are frequently targeted by scammers who attempt to deceive users with fraudulent messages. There is a critical need for an automated system that can identify these scams and warn users as they interact on these platforms, thereby enhancing user safety, trust, and overall platform integrity.
